This is a D&A lesson quite outdated, not using any modern features of c++.
If you want to learn in a more modern way (maybe also a clearer way), you ought to choose the same lesson which uses python as the tutorial language.
But my coding in examples and exercises applies better c++ functions and features. You can use it as a reference.
