## DO NOT CHOOSE the class of whq!!! Believe me, you will regret it. It's a nightmare.

This is a D&A lesson quite outdated, which uses silly functions & poor naming conventions.
If you want to learn in a more modern way (maybe also a clearer way), you ought to choose the same lesson which uses python as the tutorial language (or you should consider other resources/try the data_structures&algorithms(A)).
But my coding patterns in examples and exercises apply better c++ functions and features (which I believe is far better). You can use it as a reference.
**Even if you have already got mastery of c++ or you are an oier, you shouldn't choose whq's class.**
